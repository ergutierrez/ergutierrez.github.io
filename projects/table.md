## Inspiration

While linguistics is a field that deals with people and their speech, we sometimes forget about the impact that some societal behaviors may have on certain groups. As such, [TABLE](https://lx.berkeley.edu/towards-better-linguistics-environment-table) organizers decided to get together to create a talk series to inform linguists and others interested in the intersection of language and social justice to learn about steps that we can take to make the field a more inclusive one.

## What it does

TABLE is a special Fall Colloquium Series hosted by the Linguistics Department. This series aims to give space to socially and theoretically important topics which are historically neglected within the fields of linguistics and language studies. Speakers will touch on topics including language and gender, language and race, signed language, language and ability, decolonizing linguistics, and social justice pedagogy. While a primary goal of this series is to generate ideas for GSIs and faculty across departments to incorporate directly into their teaching and research, this talk series will be of interest to the general public and all are welcome.
